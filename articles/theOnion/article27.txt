LANGLEY, VA—Central Intelligence Agency director George Tenet conceded Monday that the organization excels at overthrowing foreign governments but isn’t so hot at the actual intelligence gathering. “Iran, Zaire, Guatemala, Chile, Indonesia, Greece, Panama, Australia, Haiti… we’re real good at toppling regimes,” Tenet said. “But just collecting your basic data about who’s up to what in the U.S. and whatnot, that’s not our strong suit.” Tenet added that if the U.S. needed to “swoop in and take out Colombia’s current government, man, we could have that done by the weekend.”
