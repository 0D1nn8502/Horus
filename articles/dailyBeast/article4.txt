If The New Abnormal co-hosts Andy Levy and Danielle Moodie were shocked by Donald Trump’s landslide election win, nothing could prepare them for what was to come: Trump’s Cabinet picks.

“It is evident to me that one of the goals of white delusion, white supremacy is to shove in people’s faces that you don’t need to be qualified,” Moodie said. “You don’t need to be smart. You don’t even need to have been an active lawyer for a bunch of years in a credible firm or credible space. All you have to do to ascend to power is to be white, is to be cis, is to be associated with Donald Trump and love him and have tap-danced for him over the past nine years. And that is a shoo-in for any position.”
