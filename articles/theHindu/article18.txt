Kashyap ‘Kash’ Patel, former chief of staff to the U.S. Secretary of Defense and president-elect Donald Trump’s choice to be the next FBI director, was allegedly targeted by Iran-linked agents who hacked some of his communications, per two anonymous sources, reported CNN.

It was not clear when the hack first took place, and what actions had been taken in response. An official spokesperson would not confirm or deny the allegations, but simply outlined Patel’s role in president-elect Trump’s future administration.

This is not the first time that hackers linked to Iran have compromised data belonging to Trump or his supporters, according to other anonymous sources.

The FBI in September announced that Iran hackers tried to entice President Joe Biden with stolen information from rival Trump’s campaign.

Microsoft had also warned that foreign powers were trying to threaten the integrity of the U.S. election this year.
