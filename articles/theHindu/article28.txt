Through the unique Constitution made for the country, Baba Saheb is always a ray of hope for the exploited and oppressed and lives in the hearts of the people. Governments should also properly implement his Constitution and work for the welfare of the Bahujans so that India becomes a great country free from poverty and unemployment, with peace, happiness, and prosperity,” Ms. Mayawati said in a statement.
