According to the official order, the committee must submit its report and recommendations to the government in a month.

Earlier, a committee under the chairmanship of Revenue Board Chairman was formed to make recommendations on the matter. The newly formed committee will deliberate on those recommendations and is expected to submit its report in one month.

Farmers from several districts of Uttar Pradesh began their agitation on December 2, seeking adequate compensation for land acquired and other demands. They were halted at the Uttar Pradesh-Delhi border by authorities. Over 160 farmers were later arrested on December 3.

Farmers from U.P. will gather near Greater Noida’s Zero Point at Pari Chowk for a mahapanchayat to ascertain the next steps for the ongoing agitation. Farmer leaders say they will demand that the arrested farmers be released.
